enhance the security of wireless camera systems by identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities related to wireless communication. 

Project: Enhancing Camera Security
Description:
This project focuses on improving the security of wireless camera systems by identifying vulnerabilities related to wireless communication and proposing a solution to mitigate these risks. With the rise in the use of wireless cameras for security purposes, these systems can be susceptible to interference and unauthorized access through wireless packet sniffing and jamming.

Technologies Used:

ESP32 Microcontroller: Used to simulate and analyze wireless communication between cameras and their controlling devices.
Wireless Network Analysis Tools (Wireshark): Employed to detect potential vulnerabilities such as packet loss, signal interference, and unauthorized data interception.

Key Features:

Vulnerability Identification: Conducted tests to explore how external interference, such as interference, could disrupt the normal operation of wireless cameras, affecting their ability to transmit secure footage.
Interference Demonstration: Demonstrated how these vulnerabilities could be exploited to compromise camera functionality or hijack the transmission of video data.
Proposed Solution: To mitigate these risks, the project proposed an approach to hardwire the cameras directly to a network, thereby bypassing the vulnerabilities in wireless communication and improving overall system security.

Outcome:
This project resulted in a more secure and reliable camera setup by eliminating wireless packet interference risks. The use of a wired connection enhanced both security and speed of the camera system.
